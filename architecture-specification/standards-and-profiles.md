# Standards and Profiles

## IHE Profiles

The following are the [IHE](http://www.ihe.net) [profiles](http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php?title=Profiles#IHE\_IT\_Infrastructure\_Profiles) that OpenHIE is working toward demonstrating or has demonstrated as supported in reference implementations. However, the OpenHIE architecture is **not limited to supporting these profiles**.

| [ADX](http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php?title=Aggregate\_Data\_Exchange)                                    | The **Aggregate Data Exchange (ADX)** Profile enables interoperable public health reporting of aggregate health data. ADX will typically be used to represent routinely reported aggregate data such as the numerators and denominators which can be used in the construction of public health indicators. Refer to the [Aggregate Reporting Workflows](../introduction/aggregate-reporting-workflows/) for more information on how this is used.                                                                                                                                               |

Refer to the [Aggregate Reporting Workflows](../introduction/aggregate-reporting-workflows/) for more information on how this is used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [ADX-HIV](https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Aggregate\_Data\_Exchange\_-\_HIV)                             | The ADX (**Aggregate Data Exchange)** profile affords data exchange partners a way to define a Data Structure Definition and the associated normative schema of the data message for a particular indicator report. To foster further adoption, the Aggregate Data Exchange-HIV (ADX-HIV) profile leverages the ADX profile version 2.1, which is currently published for trial implementation, to develop a content specification specifically for HIV. Refer to the [Aggregate Reporting Workflows](../introduction/aggregate-reporting-workflows/) for more information on how this is used. |

| [ATNA](http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php?title=Audit\_Trail\_and\_Node\_Authentication)                     | The **Audit Trail and Node Authentication (ATNA)** Integration Profile establishes security measures which, together with the Security Policy and Procedures, provide patient information confidentiality, data integrity and user accountability                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [CSD](ftp://ftp.ihe.net/DocumentPublication/CurrentPublished/ITInfrastructure/IHE\_ITI\_Suppl\_CSD.pdf) | The **Care Services Discovery (CSD)** Profile supports queries across related directories containing data about: organizations, facilities, services and providers. Queries against an optional “FreeBusy” service are also supported; this FreeBusy information would support the development of a list of schedulable time slots for providers or services at specific facilities. Refer to the [Care Services Discovery](../introduction/care-services-discovery/) workflows for more information on how this is used.                                                                       |

| [mCSD](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/ITI/IHE\_ITI\_Suppl\_mCSD.pdf)                       | **Mobile Care Services Discovery** Profile supports queries across related directories containing data about: organizations, facilities, services and providers. Based on HL7 FHIR. Refer to the [Care Services Discovery](../introduction/care-services-discovery/) for more information on how this is used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [MHD](http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Mobile\_access\_to\_Health\_Documents\_\(MHD\))                     | **Mobile Access to Health Documents** profile defines a simple HTTP interface to an XDS like environment. The MHD profile is intended for any system that prefers the simplified HTTP RESTful technology rather than the more robust technology used in XDS. It defines transactions to a) submit a set of documents and metadata from the mobile device to a document receiver, b) find the document submission set metadata based on query parameters; c) find document entries containing metadata based on query parameters, and d) retrieve a copy of a specific document.                 |
| [MHDS](https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Mobile\_Health\_Document\_Sharing\_\(MHDS\))                      | The **Mobile Health Document Sharing** profile specifies how a collection of IHE profiles can be used by communities for exchanging health information. These IHE profiles include support for patient identification, health document location and retrieval, provider directories, and the protection of privacy and security. MHDS shows how several IHE profiles work together to provide a standards-based, interoperable approach to community health information sharing.                                                                                                                |

| [PDQm](http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php?title=Patient\_Demographics\_Query\_for\_Mobile\_\(PDQm\))         | The **Patient Demographics Query for Mobile (PDQm)** Profile defines a lightweight RESTful interface to a patient demographics supplier leveraging technologies readily available to mobile applications and lightweight browser based applications. The functionality is identical to the PDQ Profile described in the ITI TF-1:8.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| [PMIR](https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Patient\_Master\_Identity\_Registry\_\(PMIR\))                    | The **Patient Master Identity Registry** (PMIR) Profile supports the creating, updating and deprecating of patient master identity information about a subject of care, as well as subscribing to changes to the patient master identity, using the HL7 FHIR standard resources and RESTful transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [SVCM](https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Sharing\_Valuesets,\_Codes\_and\_Maps\_\(SVCM\))                  | **Shared Valuesets, Codes, and Maps** provides basic transactions associated with Terminology Services. Transactions are based on FHIR CodeSystem, ValueSet, and ConceptMap Resource operations. SVCM is currently in Trial Implementation status.
