# OpenHIE Facility Registry (FR)

The purpose of a health facility registry is to act as the central authority to collect, store, and distribute an up to date and standardized set of facility data.  The resulting standardized and current facility dataset stored in the registry is called the Master Facility List (MFL).  While these concepts are closely related, a facility registry can be understood as the technology that manages and shares facility data and an MFL is the standardized data stored in the tool.&#x20;
