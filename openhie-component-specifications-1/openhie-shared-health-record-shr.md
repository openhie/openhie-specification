# OpenHIE Shared Health Record (SHR)

The Shared Health Record (SHR) facilitates the sharing of clinical information between health information systems to enable better patient care, thus improving health outcomes. The Shared Health Record is a means of allowing different services to share health data stored in a centralized data repository. It contains a subset of normalized data for a patient from various systems such as an electronic medical record or the Laboratory Information Management System. This record is queried and updated between the different institutions and systems that are authorized to do so. The Shared Health Record is distinct from a data warehouse; it is an operational, real-time transactional data source.

A shared health record is normalised if all metadata items such as patient, provider, and facility identifiers are resolved to appropriate universal identifiers (as opposed to their local identifiers as used by a client system). In addition, all terminology codes in use need to be mapped to an appropriate reference terminology to ensure that the information is consistently understood.

## **OpenHIE SHR Workflow Requirements**

A [core principle of the OpenHIE architecture](https://wiki.ohie.org/display/resources/Architectural+Principals) is to allow the various infrastructure services (such as the SHR) to be interchangeable. To support this, the [OpenHIE Standards and Profiles](https://wiki.ohie.org/display/documents/OpenHIE+Standards+and+Profiles) used by the Shared Health Record are outlined in the workflows below.

To be an OHIE SHR component, the SHR application must be able to support the OHIE workflows listed below. Implementations may support only the workflows needed to support their use case:
