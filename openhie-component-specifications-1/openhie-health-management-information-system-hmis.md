# OpenHIE Health Management Information System  (HMIS)

A Health Management Information System (HMIS), also called a Routine Health Information System, facilitates the collection of periodic health service delivery and public health indicators from a variety of information systems and the effective use of information at facility, district, and higher levels to help improve health care outcomes.
