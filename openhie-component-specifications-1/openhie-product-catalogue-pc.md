# OpenHIE Product Catalogue (PC)

A Product Catalogue serves as the source of truth about what a Product is within an HIE. It sources the information for this role through two expected means:  1) as the ongoing result of a process of master data management to properly define and categorize medical products and 2) as derived data on the proper definition and categorization of medical products (e.g., GS1 GDSN).
