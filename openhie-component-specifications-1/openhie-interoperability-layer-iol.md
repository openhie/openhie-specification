# OpenHIE Interoperability Layer  (IOL)

While the roles of other OHIE components that provide services may be more easily understood, it is the IOL that secures and orchestrates the exchange of information. Similar to an orchestra conductor, the IOL provides the central force that enables all of the HIE components to work together and interact with Point-of-Service systems outside the HIE.

## **OpenHIE IOL Workflow Requirements**&#x20;

To be OHIE IOL component, the IOL application must be able to support the following required standard:

In addition to this, the Interoperability layer is architected to be the single point of entry into an HIE. This means that the IOL should be involved in every OpenHIE workflow. It transparently handles transaction routing, security and auditing as these are common functions that are necessary in all workflows.
