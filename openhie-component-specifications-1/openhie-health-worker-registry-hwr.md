# OpenHIE Health Worker Registry (HWR)

The system shall support the ability to set up and manage users, permissions for reading data, writing data (posting, validation, publishing), viewing data and system administration. The Health Worker Registry serves as the central authority for maintaining the unique identities of health workers within a country. The Health Worker Registry is a database containing a minimum dataset of details of all health workers working in both the public and private sectors. With multiple and disparate sources of data on health workers, it is a complex task to pull together and maintain a master and canonical list of all health workers in a country. The health worker registry seeks to reduce the complexity of this task by: &#x20;

* Pulling the minimum dataset of health workforce information from the various source data systems.&#x20;
* Merging the source data systems into an authoritative registry of health workers according to a data governance policy.&#x20;
* Allowing queries of health worker information by client systems.

## **OpenHIE HWR Workflow Requirements**

A [core principle of the OpenHIE architecture](https://wiki.ohie.org/display/resources/Architectural+Principals) is to allow the various infrastructure services (such as the HWR) to be interchangeable. To support this, the [OpenHIE Standards and Profiles](https://wiki.ohie.org/display/documents/OpenHIE+Standards+and+Profiles) used by the Health Worker Registry are outlined in the workflows below. &#x20;

To be an OHIE HWR component, the HWR application must be able to support the OHIE workflows listed below.  Implementations may support only the workflows needed to support their use case:\
