# OpenHIE Component Specifications

The purpose of the OpenHIE Component Specification section is to outline what it means to be an OpenHIE Component.  (The OpenHIE Components are depicted in the gray box in figure 2.1).  Each of the components is defined and requirements and recommendations are documented.  Additionally, the non-functional requirements outlined in section 4 of this document are applicable to each OpenHIE Component. &#x20;

For a software application to meet OpenHIE expectations for a specific component role in OpenHIE, that software must support any “required” workflows and any other “required” functionality. ****&#x20;

**Definitions:** &#x20;

* **Recommendation:**  The recommendation is encouraged and viewed as an important function or workflow that supports OpenHIE goals.&#x20;
* **Requirement:**  To qualify as an OpenHIE Component, the required function or workflow must be supported.&#x20;
