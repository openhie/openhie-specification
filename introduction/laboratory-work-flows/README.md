# Laboratory Work Flows

The workflows are designed to support the following types of data exchanges:

* Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems can send an electronic lab order to a laboratory information system (LIS).
* A LIS can send lab results electronically to an EMR&#x20;
* For more information on exemplary implementations, please contact the LIS COP.
