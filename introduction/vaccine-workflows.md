# Vaccine Workflows

This collection of workflows allows an external system with access to the HIE to save and retrieve vaccine status.  &#x20;

The workflows are designed to support the following types of data exchanges with systems that have access to the HIE.

1. A system can record a vaccine document to the HIE using the [Save Patient-level Clinical Data Workflow](shared-health-record/save-patient-level-clinical-data-workflow.md) transaction. &#x20;
2. A system can query for a vaccine document from the HIE using the [Query Patient-level Clinical Data Workflow](shared-health-record/query-patient-level-clinical-data-workflow.md) transaction. &#x20;
