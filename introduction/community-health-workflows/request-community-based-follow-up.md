# Request Community Based Follow-Up

## Overview

This workflow allows a point-of-care system to make requests to a Community Health Information System (CHIS) for patient follow-up. A common implementation is for Lost to Follow-Up whereby a clinic generates a list of patients who have missed appointments for follow-up through CHIS. During the follow-up, Community Health Workers (CHW) encourage the identified patients to attend their appointments and seek to understand the reason for non-attendance. The follow-up process may involve a CHW physically going to find the patient or reaching out through other communication protocols such as phone call or SMS.

| 1      | Determine Patients Requiring Follow-up | Using an EMR or other Point-of-care system, the users will designate patients that require community-based follow-up.  This may be due to a missed appointment or other action triggering a follow-up. | \~\~\~\~                  |
| 2, 3   | ServiceRequest                         | A service request is created with "Active" status and sent through the IOL to the SHR.  The IOL may need to orchestrate use of the patient identity used in the HIE.  These steps are not shown.       | FHIR ServiceRequest       |
