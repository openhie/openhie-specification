# Aggregate Reporting Workflows

This collection of workflows is designed to support aggregate data exchange of health indicators. To fully support this capability, metadata describing the indicators also needs to be translated or exchanged. &#x20;

The workflows in this collection are designed to support the following types of data exchanges:

1. Sending an aggregate data message from an HIE or another application.
2. An HIE receiving an aggregate data message.
