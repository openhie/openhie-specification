# Patient Identity Management Workflows

The Client Registry is designed to assist in uniquely identifying individuals who receive healthcare services in the geographic region and/or use cases supported HIE.

The workflows are designed to support the following types of data exchanges:

* A Point-of-Service (PoS) systems such as EMRs or other patient identity sources can add or update a patient's demographics information in the Client Registry.
* A Point-of-Service (PoS) or other system that is authorized to access the HIE can query the Client Registry for the patient's unique id or demographic information.
* For more information on exemplary implementations, please contact the Client Registry Community.
