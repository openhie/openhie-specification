# Shared Health Record

This collection of workflows allows an external system with access to the HIE to save and retrieve information from the HIE.

The workflows are designed to support the following types of data exchanges with systems that have authority to access the HIE:

1. A point-of-care or external system can query for previous encounters for a specific patient.
2. This transaction allows a PoC or an external system to provide data to the HIE's SHR.
3. A point-of-care or external system can request and receive an on-demand document from the HIE's SHR.
